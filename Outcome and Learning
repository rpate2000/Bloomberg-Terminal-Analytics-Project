**Abstract** 
This project simulates Bloomberg Terminal-style financial analytics using Power BI, SQL, DAX, and Excel.
The primary objective is to showcase end-to-end data modeling, transformation, and visualization skills while generating actionable insights on portfolio and market performance. 

**Introduction** 
Financial market analysis requires integration of large datasets, robust data modeling, and clear visualizations. 
This project demonstrates a practical approach to modeling market data, portfolio holdings, and macroeconomic indicators in Power BI, simulating Bloomberg Terminal capabilities. 

**Methodology** 
1. Data Engineering: Synthetic datasets of market prices, company financials, portfolio holdings, and macroeconomic indicators were generated. 
2. SQL: Created normalized schema with staging tables and views for portfolio P&L, sector exposure, and FX change. 
3. Power Query: Cleaned, transformed, and merged datasets using M language, created a Date table, and implemented incremental refresh logic. 
4. DAX: Developed measures such as ROI, CAGR, Sharpe Ratio, Beta, and portfolio attribution. 
5. Power BI: Built a multi-page dashboard with Market Overview, Company Fundamentals, Portfolio Tracker, and Macro & FX Monitor. 

The dashboard consists of multiple pages designed to provide end-to-end analytics: 
- Market Overview: Tracks stock indices, market trends, and top movers. 
- Company Fundamentals: Highlights revenue, net income, EPS, and valuation ratios. 
- Portfolio Tracker: Monitors daily P&L, ROI, and sector exposure. 
- Macro & FX Monitor: Analyzes GDP, inflation, and currency changes. 
 
**Insights & Key Findings** 
- Portfolio sector allocation shows diversified risk exposure. 
- ROI calculations demonstrate high-performing tickers and underperformers. 
- Market trends align with macroeconomic indicators like GDP and inflation. 
- DAX measures allow detailed attribution analysis, aiding portfolio decisions. 

**Limitations & Future Enhancements** 
Limitations include use of synthetic data, absence of live Bloomberg feed, and simplified FX datasets. 
Future enhancements could involve real-time market integration, advanced forecasting models, and more complex risk-adjusted performance metrics. 

**Conclusion** 
This project showcases a complete financial analytics workflow using SQL, Power BI, DAX, and Excel. 
It demonstrates the ability to engineer datasets, build interactive dashboards, and generate actionable insights, reflecting practical skills applicable to real-world financial analysis roles.
